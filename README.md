# Ideabox

### Abstract:

This app allows a user to save their ideas. They can write the title of the idea and the content of the idea itself, which is then saved into cards that are organized into rows which they can refer to later.

### Installation Instructions:

To install the app, open terminal, navigate to your desired directory (also known as a folder), and then enter "git clone xxxx" and hit enter/return. Terminal will download the files and install them into your chosen directory.

### Context:

We are each in our first module of Turing.

### Wins + Challenges:

Challenges: We got stuck on some difficult CSS issues that took hours to resolve.
Coordinating work with four people, different time zones, sick kids, family tragedy, and personal illnesses took a lot of flexibility.
