# Ideabox 

### Abstract:

This app allows a user to save their ideas. They can write the title of the idea and the content of the idea itself, which is then saved into cards that are organized into rows which they can refer to later. 

### Installation Instructions:

To install the app, open terminal, navigate to your desired directory (also known as a folder), and then enter "git clone git@github.com:crgweller/Bestideabox.git" and hit enter/return. Terminal will download the files and install them into your chosen directory.

### Context:

We're a team of four people, and we were assigned this project one week ago. We worked on it mostly in teams of two people at a time, for roughly four hours per day, for five days.

We are each in our first module of Turing.

### Learning Goals:

Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp

Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: We completed a working MVP. We stuck to our DTR. 

Challenges: We got stuck on some difficult CSS issues that took hours to resolve. 
Coordinating work with four people, different time zones, sick kids, family tragedy, and personal illnesses took a lot of flexibility.
